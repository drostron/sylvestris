- external API client -- We have GET, need PUT and POST
- constrain allowed relationships on entity CRUD routes -- POST is done, need PUT
- data validations
- edge labels e.g. parent/child
- how do we migrate current data to this model?
- monad Transformers or something else to handle lookup and find collections
- consider Triggered Views within this world
- identifiers should be unique; add constraints for enforcement
- JsonFormat context bound is proliferating. Find a way to contain this.
- separate out into proper sbt sub-projects
- open-source it; keep the result of this work open-source ready
- revisit naming of GraphM
- tests
- pull PathSegment and NodeWithRelationships out of service and move them into service-common
- model should be more like an example project, less janrain specific
- add type level tests for GraphM linking (shapeless' illtyped)
- s/Entity/Node/g
- separate out typed and untyped access for GraphM and Graph
